# 🚗 BiyahePro — Backend Engine & Core Database Setup

Welcome to the central repository for the **BiyahePro** ride-hailing backend ecosystem. This project features a high-performance database schema using time-sortable identifiers, spatial tracking data, and a secure ASP.NET Core Web API engine powered by Dapper Micro-ORM and SignalR WebSockets.

## 🗄️ Phase 1: PostgreSQL & PostGIS Database Provisioning

This phase builds your relational database, adds location trackers, creates an isolated application user role, and inserts mock testing items.

### 🏃 Setup Commands
1. Open your terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + ~`) and connect to your database system using the absolute path:
   ```powershell
   & "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18\bin\psql.exe" -U postgres
   ```
2. Paste and run these configuration scripts **one line at a time** inside the `postgres=#` interface:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE ridehailing OWNER postgres;
   CREATE ROLE ridehailing_app WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'Pisosabohol01';
   \c ridehailing
   ```
3. Load and compile all structure scripts in their correct file order to prevent cross-relationship breaks:
   ```sql
   \(\i 00_extensions.sql    \i 01_users.sql    \i 02_drivers_vehicles.sql    \i 03_trips.sql    \i 04_payments_ratings.sql    \i 05_app_settings.sql    \i 06_seed.sql    \i 07_refresh_tokens.sql    \i 08_seed_admin.\)sql
   ```
4. Verify your structural list displays **10 tables** by executing `\dt` (Press **Spacebar** to scroll, and **q** to close the viewer panel), then type `\q` to exit.
5. `08_seed_admin.sql` creates a real, login-able admin account — see **Admin Panel Access** below.
6. **Already had a database from before this fix?** Also run `\i 09_fix_vehicle_types.sql` — it corrects the `vehicles.vehicle_type` constraint from a placeholder `sedan/suv/van/motorcycle` set to BiyahePro's actual fleet (`motorcycle`, `motorcab`). Fresh installs get this automatically from `02_drivers_vehicles.sql` and can skip it.
7. **Already had a database from before this fix?** Also run `\i 10_add_booking_fee.sql` — adds the `trips.booking_fee` column and the `fare.booking_fee` setting (₱5 default) referenced in the BP's break-even analysis. Fresh installs get this automatically from `03_trips.sql` / `06_seed.sql` and can skip it.

## 🏗️ Phase 2: ASP.NET Core API Server Construction

This phase compiles your application logic controllers, caching components, data transfer structures, and real-time mapping hooks.

### 🏃 Setup Commands
1. Jump your current terminal path into the correct backend folder:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\lague\Desktop\BiyahePro - new\RideHailing.API"
   ```
2. Verify that your `appsettings.json` file contains your connection keys and JWT safety block parameters.
3. Clean out old temporary compilation traces and trigger a fresh build check:
   ```powershell
   dotnet clean
   dotnet build
   ```
4. Boot up your application web server engine:
   ```powershell
   dotnet run
   ```
The application will light up and display that it is actively listening for web traffic on: **`http://localhost:5000`**

## 🌐 Frontend Local Access (React + Vite)

This repo includes a local admin frontend in `ridehailing-client`. It is the browser entry point where the login screen appears and where admin users authenticate before accessing the dashboard.

### 🏃 Start the frontend locally
1. Open a new terminal in VS Code and go to the client folder:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\lague\Desktop\BiyahePro - new\ridehailing-client"
   ```
2. Install dependencies if needed:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the local development server:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the browser to the Vite local URL shown in the terminal, usually:
   ```text
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### 🔐 Where the auth panel is
The login screen is the admin authentication panel rendered by the React client. It is driven by the files:
- `ridehailing-client/src/components/admin/LoginForm.jsx`
- `ridehailing-client/src/components/admin/AdminPage.jsx`
- `ridehailing-client/lib/api.js`

When the app loads, the browser shows the BiyahePro Admin sign-in form. After a successful login, the app saves the JWT in browser storage and loads the dashboard.

### 👤 Admin login credentials
Use the seeded admin account created by `ridehailing-db/08_seed_admin.sql`:
- Email: `admin@biyahepro.local`
- Password: `ChangeMe123!`

> These credentials are for local development only. Change the password before any real deployment.

### ⚠️ Back-end requirement
The frontend calls the API at:
```text
http://localhost:5000
```
So make sure the ASP.NET API is running first with:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\lague\Desktop\BiyahePro - new\RideHailing.API"
dotnet run
```
If the API is not running, the login page may fail to authenticate even though the frontend loads properly.

## 🧠 Core Engineering Features to Remember

* **UUIDv7 Standard Identifiers:** Primary keys are generated as sequential, time-sortable strings. They double as an organic creation timestamp, which speeds up search sorting without extra table columns.
* **PostGIS Radius Math:** Vehicle locations utilize geographical coordinate vectors. The repository handles efficient, ultra-fast proximity checks to discover nearby vehicles using `ST_DWithin` algorithms.
* **60-Second Configuration Cache:** App rules, fares, and surge rates are loaded through an optimized memory cache. This shields your database from repetitive hits on everyday price requests.
* **Write Audit Middleware:** A pipeline intercept log captures and records any modifying changes made by system administrators into a secure audit table.

---

## 🔑 Admin Panel Access

`SettingsController` now requires `[Authorize(Roles = "admin")]` and reads the acting admin's id from the JWT (no more hardcoded mock GUID), so the admin panel needs a **real** login to do anything.

**Dev admin credentials** (created by `08_seed_admin.sql`):
* Email: `admin@biyahepro.local`
* Password: `ChangeMe123!`

Log in via `POST /api/auth/login` to get an access token, then send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on `/api/settings` requests.

⚠️ **Change this password before any real deployment.** To reset it, edit the literal password in `08_seed_admin.sql` and re-run the file — `ON CONFLICT (email) DO UPDATE` overwrites the stored hash.

**Password policy (enforced on `POST /api/auth/register`):** minimum 8 characters, with at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one symbol. Enforced via a `RegularExpression` validation attribute on `RegisterRequest.Password` (`Models/User.cs`) — `[ApiController]` validates it automatically and returns `400` with a clear message if it fails. This is a create-time check only; there's no password-reset endpoint yet.

> **Legacy note:** the React admin client (`ridehailing-client`) previously used a hardcoded 4-digit PIN screen (`PinOverlay.jsx`, PIN `1234`) that wasn't wired to any real auth. That PIN gate is deprecated — the client should call `/api/auth/login` and store the returned JWT instead.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting & Fix Reference Guide

### 1. "The term 'psql' is not recognized"
* **Cause:** Windows doesn't know where the PostgreSQL tool is hiding.
* **Fix:** Bypass global shortcuts by running commands through its explicit computer path: `& "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18\bin\psql.exe"`.

### 2. "Did not find any tables"
* **Cause:** Running scripts while they still have a solid white circle (⚪) in your editor. This tells the database to read empty files from your drive.
* **Fix:** Always force-save all components (`Ctrl + K, S`) before deploying migrations.

### 3. Namespace Mismatch Errors (`CS0234` / `CS0246`)
* **Cause:** Files cannot see their neighbors because their header definitions are broken or sitting in incorrect directories.
* **Fix:** Ensure files start with an explicit layout name mapping line (e.g., `namespace RideHailing.API.Services;`) and verify folders use the plural names matching your architecture tree.

### 4. Code Changes Not Updating
* **Cause:** The compiler gets stuck reading an outdated system memory cache.
* **Fix:** Wipe out the old memory folders and trigger a clean build process:
  ```powershell
  Remove-Item -Path .\bin\,.\obj\ -Recurse -Force
  dotnet clean
  dotnet build
  ```
